## 1. Project Overview

**Objective:** Design an AI/ML-based fraud detection system that identifies hidden (paradoxical) fraud patterns in UPI/credit transaction datasets, providing real-time detection and explainable insights.

---

## 2. Functional & Technical Requirements
- Real-time ingestion and streaming of transaction data
- Low-latency fraud risk scoring per transaction
- Explainable anomaly/fraud detection
- Admin dashboard with case management
- Scalable, resilient, secure, API-ready deployment

---

## 3. System Architecture

### **A. Architecture Diagram (Summary)**
- **Frontend (React/Next.js, Node.js):**
  - User/Admin dashboard
  - Real-time fraud alerts visualization, case management
- **Backend (Python Flask/FastAPI or Node.js API):**
  - Handles HTTP requests, transaction API endpoints
  - Orchestrates data pipeline & model inference
- **Streaming/Event Layer:**
  - Apache Kafka or AWS Kinesis for ingesting transactions/events
- **Processing & Analytics Layer:**
  - Apache Spark (or AWS Glue/EMR) for batch/stream analytics
- **Data Storage:**
  - PostgreSQL, MongoDB (or DynamoDB) for transactional/store analytics
- **ML Model/Serving:**
  - Model training: Jupyter Notebook, TensorFlow/PyTorch, Scikit-learn, H2O
  - Real-time serving: REST API with Flask/FastAPI, Dockerized for deployment
- **Alerting:**
  - Kafka, Celery or serverless functions (email/SMS notifications)
- **Monitoring/Logging:**
  - Grafana/Prometheus or ELK Stack; login and event monitoring

## 4. Recommended Datasets

| Dataset | Description | Type           | URL                                                      |
|---------|-------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Credit Card Fraud Detection | 285k real, anonymized transactions with fraud labels | Supervised, real | https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud |
| PaySim Synthetic | Simulated mobile money transactions, including fraud | Semi-supervised | https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealaxi/paysim1         |
| Online Payment Fraud | Historical online payment transaction data; labeled | Supervised, real | https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jainilcoder/online-payment-fraud-detection |
| Financial Transactions | Comprehensive banking transaction dataset for analytics | Semi-supervised | https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/computingvictor/transactions-fraud-datasets |

**Usage Guide:**
- Download CSV from Kaggle after account setup
- Load with Pandas (`pd.read_csv('dataset.csv')`)
- Use for model training and evaluation
- Simulate UPI-like flows using PaySim if UPI-specific data is not available

---

## 5. Data Processing & Feature Engineering
1. **Exploration:**
   - Understand data schema, distribution, class imbalance
2. **Cleaning:**
   - Handle missing values, filter duplicates
3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Aggregate: Total spends, transaction counts (per window)
   - Temporal: Time between transactions, session duration
   - Behavioral: Device changes, geo-location shifts, login anomalies
   - Encodings: One-hot, scaling for ML-readiness

---

## 6. Model Training, Testing, and Evaluation
- **Model types:**
  - Supervised: Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, Logistic Regression
  - Unsupervised: Isolation Forest, Autoencoders, KMeans
- **Approach:**
  - Balance dataset via upsampling/minority class adjustment
  - Feature selection & cross-validation (StratifiedKFold)
  - Evaluate: ROC-AUC, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix
  - Use model explainability tools (LIME, SHAP) to extract interpretable insights per prediction
- **Sample code for Isolation Forest (Scikit-learn):**
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest
iso = IsolationForest(n_estimators=200, max_samples='auto', contamination=0.01)
iso.fit(X_train)
preds = iso.predict(X_test)
```

---

## 7. Model Deployment: API Integration & Serving
- Export final model as `.pkl` (joblib)
- Create REST API (Flask/FastAPI)
- Example endpoint for prediction:
```python
@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    data = request.get_json(force=True)
    features = ... # transform received JSON
    proba = model.predict([features])[0]
    return jsonify({'is_fraud': int(proba)})
```
- Dockerize and deploy with Docker Compose/K8s, or cloud/serverless solution

---

## 8. Frontend: Dashboard & Monitoring
- Build with React.js, visualize flagged anomalies per user/transaction
- Integrate with backend API for live updates
- Case management: mark transactions as legitimate/fraudulent
- Custom roles: Admin, Analyst

---

## 9. Security, Compliance, and Best Practices
- Follow PCI DSS for payment data, encrypt at rest/in transit
- Role-based authentication (Auth0, Okta, JWT guidelines)
- Audit logging of model decisions & admin actions
- Regular updates to handle new fraud vectors

---

## 10. DevOps: CI/CD, Scaling, and Monitoring
- Use GitHub/GitLab Actions for CI/CD
- Testing: unit, integration, security
- Cloud scaling: AWS EC2/EKS, Azure AKS, GCP GKE
- Monitor system health and model drift, automate model retraining when fraud trends shift
